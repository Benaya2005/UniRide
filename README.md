# UniRide ðŸš—ðŸŽ“

## Overview  
**UniRide** is a campus-based ride-sharing and on-demand transport application designed to make mobility easier for students, staff, and visitors.  
It allows users to **offer rides or request seats** for trips both **inside and outside the campus**, helping to reduce traffic, save time, and promote sustainable transport.

UniRide provides two main user roles:
- **Riders** â€“ who can browse available rides, book a seat, or schedule a future ride.
- **Drivers** â€“ who can publish ride offers, accept requests, and manage their trips.

The app also includes an **Admin** interface to manage users, verify drivers, and monitor system activity.
